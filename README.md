Budgeted time-maximization problem

Objective: To spend as much time as I can enjoying rides at the county fair, with varying ticket prices and duration of each ride. 

Solution: Apply different Algorithms: Greedy, Exhaustive and Dynamic programming in C++ to determine the noticeable difference in the performance between three Algorithms.

Calculate the step count and analyze the Algorithm code mathematically to determine its big-O efficiency class.
Gather empirical timing data by running the implementations for various values of n (number of rides), drew a scatter plot for each algorithm and fit line for the timing data.
